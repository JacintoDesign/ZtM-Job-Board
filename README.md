## Description

An open source project that I contributed to through my involvement with the Zero To Mastery Developer course on Udemy. It is for developers from all over the world to signal their availability for work. It is searchable by name, location, or job-title and includes links to developer's websites, & Linkedin and Github pages. It was built in React and Redux and it features a very cool particle effect that follows the cursor.
